# Overmind Screeps AI

Screeps is an [MMO strategy game for programmers](https://screeps.com/). The core objective is to expand your colony; to control your units, you write code in JavaScript (or any other transpiled language of your choice). The units run in real-time even when you aren't actively playing the game, so making a reliable AI to control them is important.

This is the AI system I have been developing for Screeps. It is centrally-managed and task based. Creep activities in each room are prioritized and managed by a central `RoomBrain` object, which handles task assignment and runs the spawners. Currently, the AI is mostly autonomous, requiring input only for structure construction and planning invasions, though this will eventually be automated too.

### Find me in game! (username: Muon)
I'm currently around the `W1XN8X` sector. If my AI is being too agressive, feel free to message me about it. I'm working on developing a whitelist to make Overmind stop attacking players who opt out of it.
