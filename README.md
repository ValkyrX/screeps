# Screeps AI

Screeps is an [MMO strategy game for programmers](https://screeps.com/). You write code in JavaScript (or any other transpiled language of your choice) to control your units which run in real-time even when you aren't actively playing the game.

This is the AI I have been developing for Screeps. It is centrally-managed and task based. Creep classes are consolodated down to four general types, and their activities in each room are managed by a central `RoomBrain` object. Currently, the AI is mostly autonomous, requiring input only for structure construction and offense. 

Below is a general schematic of the design of my AI.
